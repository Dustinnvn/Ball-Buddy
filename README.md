Ball Buddy is a pet ball launcher developed in my senior design class. It is inspired by a teammates dog which has separation anxiety, which would become exacerbated after work from home is lifed. In response we created a smart ball launcher so that we could help pets keep in touch with their owners from far away.

My main repsonibilites are in charge of designing and coding the ball recovery system. For the chassis design I will be working together with one of my teammates, Jason. I will also be helping on the webapp devlopment by creating a functional backend and database to control the ball recovery system.


## Key Features
* Autonomous ball recovery and launch
* Controllable through an app or webpage
* 180 degree rotational and launch angles
* Saftey sensors to avoid injury
* Camera to view pets and launch trajectory
