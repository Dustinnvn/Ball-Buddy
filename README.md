# Ball-Buddy
Ball Buddy is a pet ball launcher developed for my senior design class. It is a smart ball system that is able to automate the process of throwing a ball. It features remote control via a phone application with a camera and safety sensors to avoid accidents. My main repsonibilites are in charge of designing and coding the ball recovery system. I will be working together with one of my teammates, Jason, to design the chassis. I will also be working on the webapp devlopment creating a functional backend and database to contorl the ball recovery system.
